📊 Data Exploration & Preprocessing – Data Science Internship Project

📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, where I focused on preparing real-world datasets for analysis. The goal was to understand the structure of the data, clean it, and ensure it was ready for further processing and model building.

📊 Dataset
The dataset includes:

•Restaurant ratings and related features
•Customer feedback and cuisine information
•Aggregate rating" as the target variable

🛠️ Tech Stack
•Programming Language: Python
•Libraries Used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

🔍 Workflow
✅Dataset Overview: Loaded the dataset and examined its structure (rows, columns, datatypes).
✅Missing Values: Identified missing data and handled it using appropriate techniques (drop, fill, impute).
✅Data Type Conversion: Ensured correct data types for numeric and categorical fields.
✅Target Analysis: Explored the distribution of "Aggregate rating" and checked for class imbalance.
✅Visualization: Created charts and graphs to support insights and improve interpretability.

📈 Results
•Cleaned and structured dataset ready for modeling.
•Detected and resolved missing values and inconsistencies.
•Gained insights into the distribution and balance of the target variable.

🚀 Key Learnings
•Importance of thorough data cleaning before analysis
•Practical experience with missing data handling
•Better understanding of rating distributions and their impact on model fairness
